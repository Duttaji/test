Amplify Self-service	Intelligent Operations Support Create a chatbot and automation tool for support requests and self-service suggestions.	Tickets needing content updates, configuration, or proxy fixes; SOP/documents scattered across locations; logs needed for analysis.	Quicker turn-around via instant access to relevant info.	AI Chatbot + RAG System: Build a chatbot with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using a vector database (e.g., FAISS) to fetch SOPs/logs. Integrate with ticketing tools (e.g., ServiceNow) for auto-suggestions. Use LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) for intent classification and response generation.
Smart Search	Enhanced User Experience Contextualized search through parsing result pages.	Enhancing search results via contextual parsing to show relevant content upfront.	Relevant and contextual info shown to the user in the first go.	Semantic Search Engine: Use transformer-based models (e.g., BERT, SBERT) to build a semantic search system. Index internal documents and knowledge base articles. Rank results based on semantic similarity to the query, fine-tuning on enterprise data.
Predictive Modeling	Efficient Infrastructure Capacity Planning and Resource Allocation AI for predictive scheduling and proactive resource allocation.	Predicting downtime, planning resource needs based on workloads or traffic patterns.	Automated alerts to prevent user-reported issues and downtime.	Time Series + Anomaly Detection: Use models like Prophet, ARIMA, or LSTM for workload forecasting. Combine with anomaly detection models (Isolation Forest, AutoEncoders) for early alerting. Automate scheduling and capacity allocation using reinforcement learning agents.
Smart Infra Ops	Event Correlation and Noise Reduction AI to correlate logs and detect performance problems early.	Latency patterns causing performance issues; large batch jobs requiring manual intervention.	SLA compliance via smart remediation.	AIOps Platform: Use NLP (e.g., log parsing with LLMs or regex + embeddings), clustering (e.g., DBSCAN) to correlate events. Train supervised ML models on labeled incident data to detect root causes. Automate resolution playbooks using RPA or orchestration tools (e.g., Ansible).
